	<h1>Project Brief: MTB Karma</h1>
		<h2>Project Title & Description </h2>
		  <p><strong>MTB Karma. </strong> A website all about mountain biking, including pages devoted to favorite destinations, 
		  races and trails.   It will have a blog page for tracking latest rides/trips, 
		  as well as a links page to take users to other resources like good shops and trail-building opportunities.</p> 
		<h2>Business Needs</h2>
			<p>Business needs driving this project include the need for:
			<ul>
				<li>A rich resource for mountain bike race information</li>
				<li>A site with fun and useful resources for MTB trip planning</li>
				<li>A place where mountain bikers of all skill levels can go for inspiration and mojo</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The revenue model for this product will be based on customer advertising.  
			The site will include at least one advertising side banner. </p>
		<h2>Use Cases</h2>			
			<p>Use cases include providing data for experienced riders looking for race information, 
			trip planners seeking a great mountain biking destination, cycling enthusiasts seeking high quality photos or other
			inspiration, and anyone out to find a new trail.</p>
		<h2>Stakeholders & Users </h2>
			<p>Stakeholders will be a wide audience of mountain bikers, world-wide.  
			The kind of person that might follow this could be someone looking for a new trail to try out, 
			a place to visit, or a shop where they can buy a bike.   
			The overall goal here is to provide a fun (and ultimately expandable) site that might get a rider on the trail,
			psyched about an event, or possibly linked to other cycling resources. </p>	
		<h2>Project Requirements </h2>
			<p>The site will be structured (on initial release) to provide a minimum viable product with the following 
			web pages:
			<ul>
				<li>Home Page</li>
				<li>Top Destinations</li>
				<li>Great Rides</li>
				<li>Killer Races</li>
				<li>Trip Blog</li>
				<li>Links</Li>
			</ul>
			The current proposed architecture would be to build the site as a client-server application, with a Java REST API
			(Spring Framework) as the back-end.  The client side would be built with React.js. 
			One of the key objectives will be to provide a responsive, intuitive, and beautifully designed interface.</p>
		<h2>Success Measures </h2>
		  <p> Metrics would be based on three main elements:
		  	<ul>
				<li>Site usage data</li>
				<li>Advertising revenue</li>
				<li>User surveys</li>
			</ul>
		  </p>
		<h2>Competitors </h2>
			<p>Of course there are many competitors in this space, most notably 
		    <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/">Trailforks</a> and <a href="https://www.mtbproject.com/">MTB Project</a>.
			Both of these sites offer extraordinarily good trail detail and maps.  Another strength is functionality
			that integrates with other cycling apps such as Strava.  A significant weakness for both is a lack of information
			regarding races.  Additionally, neither site is particularly visually appealing or entertainment-oriented.  While
			users would often go to those sites to get a map, neither site would be considered a place to just hang out 
			or see what is happening.</p>
		<h2>Risks </h2>
		  <p>Key risks include: 
		  <ul>
			<li>Gaining traction with users</li>
			<li>Attracting enough advertisers to generate sufficient revenue </li>
		  </ul>
		  The main method to minimize risk will be by maintaining low overhead as the site is released.  The site will grow organically 
		  through word of mouth and through promotional materials to be distributed at races and other cycling events.
