# MTB-Karma-CSS

Project is primarily just about CSS and HTML.  

It has several bike oriented pages and a navigation menu, but deep links and actual functionality are not fully implemented.  
The point here was to make it look good with CSS.  It uses CSS Flexbox and media queries to resize and rerender, looks pretty good. 
Also using font awesome throughout for nice icons. 

IDE:  VSCode
